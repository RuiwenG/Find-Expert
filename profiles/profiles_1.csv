Clients: anyone interesting. 

I‚Äôve dedicated the last 30 years to design. I believe anything can and should be designed better. From a toilet to a skyscraper. They all matter. I graduated from Columbia with a masters degree in architecture, yet I‚Äôve always hesitated to call myself an architect. It feels limiting.  So I let my clients decide. Some days I‚Äôm an interior designer, others an architect, on TV I‚Äôm called an ‚Äúinnovator.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm here in service to beauty, to design everything more thoughtfully and with a great deal of love. Working with me is like going on a psychedelic journey to the outer edges of‚Ä¶  I pull upon my experience as an industrial designer using alternate methods and materials to go beyond what people believe is possible. 

I don‚Äôt have a style, I care more about the vibe you want to create. Let‚Äôs dance!"
