Natalie Holbrook,"ü™©ASTROLOGY FOR SALES x BUSINESS MENTORINGü™©

This bespoke offering is now available to share with the world. 

Remember JP Morgan said, ‚ÄúMillionaires don‚Äôt use astrology. Billionaires do‚Äù

üëëComment MASTERCLASS to sign up!!

I am here to teach you how I‚Äôve used astrology for making nearly half a million dollars over the last 4 years: the sales skills, business acumen and how the language of astrology has changed the way I have clarity/confidence, manifest ideal clients, grow my socials, fill my events, get my messaging and branding on point, and importantly, feel SO aligned and on purpose with my mission. 

It was all by using these secrets that we‚Äôll unlock in your chart together. 

If you are a purpose-driven entrepreneur, this reading is for you. 

We‚Äôll be going into SO much. But here‚Äôs a little of my cred in case you don‚Äôt know the background! 

Five years ago, I began syncing my work with Astrology and it changed everything for me:

üíé I was able generate $77,000 within my first ever launch.

üíé I booked 50 sales calls during that first launch and was able to work (aka ‚Äúclose‚Äù) with 90% of them. 

üíé I was the first employee + sales coach at a start up & scaled their biz from 1 > 3 million$ in sales that year.

üíé I sold out a magical retreat in Joshua Tree using transits and planetary gifts.

üíé When I look back at my 15 years of experience in working in various positions in sales: nightlife, events, marketing, entrepreneurship, I realized I was always living in alignment, but I could have taken advantage of it so much more.

I‚Äôm here to teach and share the magic! See you next week babes! üåôü™©üíé"
