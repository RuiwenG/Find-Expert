Xavier Helgesen,"I’m the Founder & Managing Director at Enduring Ventures, a long term holding company. We buy beautiful businesses and hold them forever. 

I’ve founded six venture backed businesses, acquired 24 companies, sold two businesses, raised over $300 million in debt & equity. 

Quote from one entrepreneur I advised:
“Hey. First time distributed profits from my company after growing it for 8 years.

My share is $110k, Never saw so much money in my life. All started from your question: “why don’t you make it profitable and hold it forever” when I told you I’m growing to sell it.

I didn’t hear you and kept going. We lost 30% of revenue and kept spending. Wasted over $1M on nothing and could have distributed it.

Never going back to this. All I care about now is to build a business that will generate cash for decades.”

I am the most helpful for entrepreneurs in tricky situations (down rounds, recapitalizations, co-founder drama, etc) and for acquisition entrepreneurs who want to build their own holding companies or acquire businesses. 

I can teach you how to buy businesses with millions in cash flow for no money down.

Blake Samic,"Building connective tissue for scaling tech companies. Head of Product Operations at OpenAI. Formerly founded the function at Uber and Stripe, two of the most prolific scaling tech companies during their hyper growth phases.

Product Ops accelerates a company's ability to deliver more value to more users, shortening the distance to product market fit, and systematizing for scale. This is accomplished by
(1) streamlining core processes and systems that add leverage for a product org (planning, product/go-to-market alignment, beta/launch, user feedback), and 
(2) bringing specific new products/features into operation, with efficient cross-functional and user coordination.

I’m passionate about supercharging collaboration across functions to accelerate technology business success. Nearly any tech company can benefit from stronger operations of their product org, a tighter connection with users, and a clearer alignment between product and go-to-market. I look forward to helping you on your journey.

More about my background:
************************
At Stripe, my team led or supported 200+ betas/launches every year, ensuring smooth experiences for users and user-facing employees. We managed Stripe-wide process and information rails including the company’s process for surfacing top asks from users, launch calendar, and the launch readiness process that is key for compliance and IPO readiness. I led bi-weekly C-Suite meetings for two+ years, designed to ensure awareness of all key upcoming product launches, delays and risks.

At Uber, my team built the connective tissue between product teams and operations teams around the world. We were responsible for leveraging regional experts and 600+ city teams to surface and prioritize product insights, ensuring global viability of the products/features we were building, and managing the rollout and ongoing operations of those products. Prior to Product Ops, I led Uber’s driver devices program globally, managing across multiple functions with P&L ownership. I regularly presented to the CEO and Head of Operations, and the team’s projects saved the company millions, better positioning for sustainable scaling.

Prior to Uber I led Product Management for a series C SaaS startup (acquired), and began my career in a leadership program with GE, accelerating my growth with stints in China and Europe.

""Product operations is IMO very essential for a fast-scaling product & business. One problem is that it's defined differently everywhere. Product operations leaders like Blake Samic know what they are doing, so I am very bullish on the product operations role over the long term.” 
- Shreyas Doshi, PM industry thought leader

“The principal thing is following your users. No one really talks about how… We have a very high performing, scaled Product Ops team… aggregating the asks we get from all channels. The key part is closing the loop. In every product review we now have a top ten list of what users want, and we’re clear on what’s committed or uncommitted.” 
- CPO of Stripe

“Product Ops is Uber’s secret aorta. We have built the world’s fastest growing company through a strategy of radical decentralization - and by investing in the entrepreneurial hustle of Ops teams in cities around the world. Product Ops is the connective tissue that allows this strategy to thrive while we also build out the highly scalable “heart” of our technology platform”

As a leader who has navigated early childhood trauma, I found transformative healing through expert-led psychedelic assisted therapy. 

This journey has given me a deep understanding of the unique pressures and mental health challenges faced by entrepreneurs, a group where 72% experience mental health issues, a rate much higher than the general population, as indicated by UC Berkeley studies.

My goal is to support other leaders in managing trauma while pursuing their entrepreneurial aspirations. While I'm not a medical professional, my firsthand experiences provide insightful perspectives for those seeking resources and understanding the journey of safe, psychedelic-assisted therapeutic experiences.

Here’s what we can discuss:

+ Trauma Therapy Modalities: How to explore effective trauma therapy methods, with and without psychedelics, currently at the forefront for treatment.

+ Finding Therapists: Guidance on selecting therapists skilled in integrated trauma treatment.

+ Recognizing Trauma: Identifying trauma symptoms in team members or founders for potential support.

+ Legal Status in the U.S.: General legal overview of psychedelic-assisted therapy in the U.S.

+ Choosing the Right Therapist: Key factors to consider when looking for a therapist trained in trauma and psychedelic medicine.

+ Understanding Integration: Explaining the integration process and finding professional support post-therapy.

+ Plant Medicine Retreats Abroad vs. U.S. Treatment: Comparing plant medicine retreats abroad to professional treatment in the U.S.

+ Recovery and Work Commitments: Balancing recovery with work responsibilities.

+ Music, Setting, and Intentions: The importance of music, environment, and setting intentions in therapy.

+ Learning from Mistakes: Personal lessons learned from my experiences with therapy.

+ Community and Resources: Guidance to additional community support and resources including books, podcasts, and communities.

It's important to note that my advice is based on personal experience and should not replace professional medical advice."

I have a crazy story about overcoming significant obstacles, overcoming failure, staying the course, and pursuing my dreams until I achieved them. 

I moved to Los Angeles when I was 24 years old after graduating law school with $3,000 in the bank, didn’t know anybody there, lost my job five in five and a half weeks, found a job that required a minimum 3-hour commute 6 days a week, was told I had to leave six months later, and found my third job in eight months. 

At the time I was miserable – I hated practicing law, badly needed and wanted a change, and finally convinced myself it was time to pursue my lifelong dream of starting my own company and earning a significant amount of money. 

I wrote 300 cold letters to CEOs after being told nobody would meet with me, landed 80 meetings, was hired as the Assistant to the Chairman at a Fortune 500 company, stayed for three years, saved up enough money to live without a salary, started a company in Boston with three people at MIT that grew in value to $14 billion in less than two years, and started my own VC firm among many other companies.
