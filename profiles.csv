Natalie Holbrook,"🪩ASTROLOGY FOR SALES x BUSINESS MENTORING🪩

This bespoke offering is now available to share with the world. 

Remember JP Morgan said, “Millionaires don’t use astrology. Billionaires do”

👑Comment MASTERCLASS to sign up!!

I am here to teach you how I’ve used astrology for making nearly half a million dollars over the last 4 years: the sales skills, business acumen and how the language of astrology has changed the way I have clarity/confidence, manifest ideal clients, grow my socials, fill my events, get my messaging and branding on point, and importantly, feel SO aligned and on purpose with my mission. 

It was all by using these secrets that we’ll unlock in your chart together. 

If you are a purpose-driven entrepreneur, this reading is for you. 

We’ll be going into SO much. But here’s a little of my cred in case you don’t know the background! 

Five years ago, I began syncing my work with Astrology and it changed everything for me:

💎 I was able generate $77,000 within my first ever launch.

💎 I booked 50 sales calls during that first launch and was able to work (aka “close”) with 90% of them. 

💎 I was the first employee + sales coach at a start up & scaled their biz from 1 > 3 million$ in sales that year.

💎 I sold out a magical retreat in Joshua Tree using transits and planetary gifts.

💎 When I look back at my 15 years of experience in working in various positions in sales: nightlife, events, marketing, entrepreneurship, I realized I was always living in alignment, but I could have taken advantage of it so much more.

I’m here to teach and share the magic! See you next week babes! 🌙🪩💎"

Principal Rod Winterrowd describes his style as ‘tailored, crisp, contemporary, yet steeped in classism. It is based on a contemporary interpretation of the formalist architectural principles and tenets of order and balance. We work with clients to create beautiful, classic interiors, for both new construction and remodels of existing properties”.

My philosophy is based on the following principles:
 • To offer superior service.
 • To begin each new project with a strategic plan that adheres to order, discipline, and organization, resulting in a project that is on time, on budget, and beautifully executed.
 • To foster a relationship between client and designer that translates into a home complimenting the taste and lifestyle of the client, not the designer. 
 • To operate in an atmosphere that fosters goodwill, teamwork, and collaboration among employees.
 • To recognize that all of our clients expect and deserve the highest levels of discretion.

What I can help you with :

-Floor plan layout 
-My favorite showrooms & stores
-Window treatments
-Finishes, paint selections
-Fabrics & wallpapers
-Editing & restyling 
-How to organize your start effectively…. and so much more.

Believe it or not, this is what I love doing. Of course, the big projects are always alluring, but this is lots of fun and brings me a great deal of joy.

I have a crazy story about overcoming significant obstacles, overcoming failure, staying the course, and pursuing my dreams until I achieved them. 

I moved to Los Angeles when I was 24 years old after graduating law school with $3,000 in the bank, didn’t know anybody there, lost my job five in five and a half weeks, found a job that required a minimum 3-hour commute 6 days a week, was told I had to leave six months later, and found my third job in eight months. 

At the time I was miserable – I hated practicing law, badly needed and wanted a change, and finally convinced myself it was time to pursue my lifelong dream of starting my own company and earning a significant amount of money. 

I wrote 300 cold letters to CEOs after being told nobody would meet with me, landed 80 meetings, was hired as the Assistant to the Chairman at a Fortune 500 company, stayed for three years, saved up enough money to live without a salary, started a company in Boston with three people at MIT that grew in value to $14 billion in less than two years, and started my own VC firm among many other companies.

I’ve founded six venture backed businesses, acquired 24 companies, sold two businesses, raised over $300 million in debt & equity. 

Quote from one entrepreneur I advised:
“Hey. First time distributed profits from my company after growing it for 8 years.

My share is $110k, Never saw so much money in my life. All started from your question: “why don’t you make it profitable and hold it forever” when I told you I’m growing to sell it.

I didn’t hear you and kept going. We lost 30% of revenue and kept spending. Wasted over $1M on nothing and could have distributed it.

Never going back to this. All I care about now is to build a business that will generate cash for decades.”

I am the most helpful for entrepreneurs in tricky situations (down rounds, recapitalizations, co-founder drama, etc) and for acquisition entrepreneurs who want to build their own holding companies or acquire businesses. 

I can teach you how to buy businesses with millions in cash flow for no money down.

I’m passionate about supercharging collaboration across functions to accelerate technology business success. Nearly any tech company can benefit from stronger operations of their product org, a tighter connection with users, and a clearer alignment between product and go-to-market.

I regularly presented to the CEO and Head of Operations, and the team’s projects saved the company millions, better positioning for sustainable scaling.

Prior to Uber I led Product Management for a series C SaaS startup (acquired), and began my career in a leadership program with GE, accelerating my growth with stints in China and Europe.

""Product operations is IMO very essential for a fast-scaling product & business. One problem is that it's defined differently everywhere. Product operations leaders like Blake Samic know what they are doing, so I am very bullish on the product operations role over the long term.” 
- Shreyas Doshi, PM industry thought leader

“The principal thing is following your users. No one really talks about how… We have a very high performing, scaled Product Ops team… aggregating the asks we get from all channels. The key part is closing the loop. In every product review we now have a top ten list of what users want, and we’re clear on what’s committed or uncommitted.” 
- CPO of Stripe

“Product Ops is Uber’s secret aorta. We have built the world’s fastest growing company through a strategy of radical decentralization - and by investing in the entrepreneurial hustle of Ops teams in cities around the world. Product Ops is the connective tissue that allows this strategy to thrive while we also build out the highly scalable “heart” of our technology platform” 
- Sr Product Director, Uber.

“Product Ops add a ton and make our whole org work better/faster” 
- VP Operations, Uber"

the same process applies:

- Build a stronger, more profitable company.
- Maximise its value.
- Maintain your sanity(!)

Consultants, brokers and bankers focus on transactions.

What do you need?

Surviving a major stroke at 30 taught me:

- Life is fragile, don't waste it.
- Success isn’t just about money (but money helps).
- The juice in life is found in surfing challenges and living with intention.

As a leader who has navigated early childhood trauma, I found transformative healing through expert-led psychedelic assisted therapy. 

This journey has given me a deep understanding of the unique pressures and mental health challenges faced by entrepreneurs, a group where 72% experience mental health issues, a rate much higher than the general population, as indicated by UC Berkeley studies.

My goal is to support other leaders in managing trauma while pursuing their entrepreneurial aspirations. While I'm not a medical professional, my firsthand experiences provide insightful perspectives for those seeking resources and understanding the journey of safe, psychedelic-assisted therapeutic experiences.

Here’s what we can discuss:

+ Trauma Therapy Modalities: How to explore effective trauma therapy methods, with and without psychedelics, currently at the forefront for treatment.

+ Finding Therapists: Guidance on selecting therapists skilled in integrated trauma treatment.

+ Recognizing Trauma: Identifying trauma symptoms in team members or founders for potential support.

+ Recovery and Work Commitments: Balancing recovery with work responsibilities.

+ Music, Setting, and Intentions: The importance of music, environment, and setting intentions in therapy.

+ Learning from Mistakes: Personal lessons learned from my experiences with therapy.

+ Community and Resources: Guidance to additional community support and resources including books, podcasts, and communities.

It's important to note that my advice is based on personal experience and should not replace professional medical advice."

Founder @ Delphos

Call me for advice on fundraising, cybersecurity, entrepreneurship, career advice, or foreign policy. 

Fundraising. I’ve experienced it as both a VC and a founder and can offer an empathic and sound advice and introductions. 

Cybersecurity, AI, and business software. I’ve worn a lot of hands in my career, but I’ve worked in those fields for 20+ years. 

Entrepreneurship. I’ve seen it from both sides: I watched a bunch of really talented people start businesses as their VC, and then I started my own business and experienced the challenges firsthand. Call me for ideas or if you want to vent. 

Career advice. I took a circuitous route and loved it, but I also watched accomplished people take different routes and learned from their journeys too. Call me if you’re a high-achiever but a little lost

Foreign policy and national security. Five years at CIA gave me an immensely interesting perspective and I love talking about US foreign policy and where the world is heading"
